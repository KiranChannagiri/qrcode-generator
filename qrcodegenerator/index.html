<!-- The backticks (`) are used to define a template literal. -->
<!-- Interpolation in JavaScript, specifically within the context of strings, refers to the process of inserting dynamic values or expressions into a string. This is often achieved using template literals, which are strings delimited by backticks (\` \`) that allow for embedding expressions directly within the string.

Here's a simple example:

```javascript
const name = "John";
const age = 30;

const message = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;

console.log(message);
// Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
```

In this example, `${name}` and `${age}` are placeholders within the template literal. When the string is evaluated, JavaScript replaces these placeholders with the actual values of the variables `name` and `age`. This dynamic substitution of values into the string is what's referred to as interpolation.

Interpolation makes it easier and more readable to construct strings that include dynamic content, such as variable values or the results of expressions, without the need for explicit concatenation or string manipulation. -->
